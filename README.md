### Titanic Survival Prediction | Titanic Classification

A prediction of a passenger's survival in the Titanic based on various features such as age, gender, class, and more.

## About the Project üíª

The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. On April 15, 1912, the Titanic sank after hitting an iceberg, resulting in the deaths of over 1,500 passengers and crew. This project attempts to predict whether a given passenger survived or not using machine learning algorithms. 

**Key components of this project include:**

- Data preprocessing and cleaning.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the dataset.
- Feature engineering to create meaningful features.
- Model selection and training.
- Model evaluation and performance metrics.

## Project Workflow üìö

The project follows a structured workflow:

1. **Data Collection and Overview:** Load the Titanic dataset and inspect its structure and content.

2. **Data Preprocessing and Cleaning:** Handle missing values, outliers, and encode categorical variables.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualize and understand relationships between variables.

4. **Feature Engineering:** Create new features like age groups, extracted titles, etc.

5. **Model Selection and Training:** Train different models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests.

6. **Model Evaluation and Performance Metrics:** Evaluate accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and perform hyperparameter tuning.

7. **Conclusion and Results:** Summarize findings and identify impactful features and best-performing models.
