# üö¢ Titanic Survival Prediction

A machine learning project to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster using classification algorithms.

---

## üß† Overview

This project builds a predictive model that determines which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck of 1912, based on features like age, sex, passenger class, fare, and embarkation point.

## üìÇ Project Structure

1. **Data Import**  
   - The dataset includes `train.csv`, `test.csv`, and `gender_submission.csv` from the Kaggle Titanic competition.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Handle missing values (`Age`, `Embarked`, `Fare`).  
   - Analyze feature distributions and correlations with survival.

3. **Feature Engineering**  
   - Create new features:
     - **Title** extracted from names (`Mr.`, `Mrs.`, etc.)
     - **FamilySize** from `SibSp + Parch + 1`
   - Encode categorical variables (`Sex`, `Embarked`, `Title`) using Label Encoding or One-Hot Encoding.

4. **Model Building**  
   - Models used include:
     - Logistic Regression  
     - Random Forest Classifier  
     - K-Nearest Neighbors  
   - Hyperparameter tuning using `GridSearchCV`.

5. **Evaluation**  
   - Evaluate models using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score.  
   - Plot Confusion Matrix.

6. **Prediction and Submission**  
   - Generate `submission.csv` for Kaggle submission.

## üìà Results

- Best model: `Random Forest Classifier`  
- Accuracy achieved: approximately **82‚Äì84%** on validation data  
- Most important features: `Sex`, `Pclass`, `Age`, `FamilySize`, and `Title`
